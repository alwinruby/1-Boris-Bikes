Aim - Can you use a test-driven approach to write object-oriented code?


Ask yourself the same two questions:

  Are you having fun?

  Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

1. Project set up
2. User Stories
        Bike <-- working? --> true/false
        DockingStation <-- release_bike --> a Bike
3. From a Domain Model to a Feature Test
4. Errors are good - they give you information about what exactly is wrong.
5. Feature Tests to Unit Tests
    RSpec, Object Specification.
      install RSpec - gem install rspec
      set up RSpec - rspec --init
      Ruby Errors and RSpec Errors - difference.
6. Passing your first unit test
